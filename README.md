#  OOP Coffee Machine {Python program}
Here's a brief description of its functionality:

- The program starts by importing necessary classes: `Menu`, `MenuItem` from `menu`, `CoffeeMaker` from `coffee_maker`, and `MoneyMachine` from `money_machine`.
- It then creates instances of these classes: `coffee_maker`, `money_machine`, and `menu`.
- The coffee machine is initially turned on, indicated by the variable `is_on` set to `True`.
- In the while loop, the program continuously asks the user for their choice of drink from the available options.
- If the user inputs "off", the coffee machine turns off, and the program ends.
- If the user inputs "report", the program prints a report showing the coffee machine's resources and the money machine's financial status.
- If the user inputs a drink name, the program checks if there are sufficient resources to make that drink and if the user has inserted enough money. If both checks pass, it makes the coffee.

Please note that this is a high-level description. The exact functionality will depend on how these classes (`Menu`, `MenuItem`, `CoffeeMaker`, and `MoneyMachine`) are implemented.

## Tech Stack
The coffee machine program you provided appears to be written in **Python**, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.

The program also seems to use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This is evident from the use of classes (`Menu`, `MenuItem`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`) and objects (`coffee_maker`, `money_machine`, `menu`). OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.


## Documentation
Here are the documentations for the technologies you mentioned:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software as a collection of objects, each with its own state and behavior. OOP allows for code reuse, modularity, and abstraction. Some of the main concepts of OOP are:

- **Classes and objects**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects of a certain type. An object is an instance of a class that has specific values for the properties and methods defined by the class.
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, called the superclass or parent class. The inheriting class is called the subclass or child class. Inheritance enables code reuse and polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to behave differently depending on its type or context. For example, a subclass object can override a method inherited from its superclass, or an object can implement multiple interfaces that define different behaviors.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. Encapsulation ensures that only the object itself can access and modify its state, and that other objects can interact with it only through its public interface. Encapsulation enhances data integrity and security.

Different programming languages support OOP in different ways. Some languages, such as Java and C++, are designed with OOP as their main paradigm. Other languages, such as Python and PHP, are multi-paradigm languages that allow OOP as well as other styles of programming.

## Lessons Learned
The coffee machine program you provided can teach several important programming concepts and best practices:

1. **Modularity**: The program is divided into separate modules (`menu`, `coffee_maker`, `money_machine`), each responsible for a specific part of the functionality. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The program uses classes and objects, which are fundamental concepts of OOP. Understanding how to design classes and how to work with objects is crucial for many modern programming languages.

3. **Abstraction**: The details of how the menu, coffee maker, and money machine work are hidden behind their respective classes. This allows you to work with these components at a high level without worrying about their internal implementation.

4. **User Interaction**: The program interacts with the user through the console, taking input and providing output. This demonstrates how a program can be designed to be interactive.

5. **Control Flow**: The program uses a while loop to continuously serve coffee until the user decides to turn it off. This shows how loops can be used to control the flow of a program.

6. **Error Checking**: Before making a coffee, the program checks if there are enough resources and if the user has inserted enough money. This shows the importance of checking for potential errors or issues before they occur.
